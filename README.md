Description: In this repository are two python files to analyse their two corresponding csv files.
              The first folder, PyBank, contains python code to analyse budet_data.csv which you will find in the Resource folder.
							
              We required the following results:
              1. The total number of months included in the dataset       
        			2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
        			3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
        			4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
        			5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

							The second folder, PyPoll, contains python code to analyse election_data.csv which you will also find in its own Resource folder.

							We required the following results:
			 				1. The total number of votes cast
							2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
              3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
              4. The total number of votes each candidate won
              5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

  How to run:  Ensure you have downloaded the PyBank and PyPoll folders
                    Use your Terminal program to CD into the directory where these folders are stored
                    Run the file in your Terminal for you to receive back the data required
